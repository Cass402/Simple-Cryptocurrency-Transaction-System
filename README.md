# Simple-Cryptocurrency-Transaction-System

Beginner Project on Blockchain

This project uses a virtual Python environment to localize dependencies. Follow these steps to set up and activate the environment, and to install the necessary dependencies:

1. **Create a virtual environment** (skip if you already have one):

   - Open the terminal.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run `python3 -m venv venv` to create a virtual environment named `venv`.

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On macOS or Linux, run `source venv/bin/activate`.
   - Your terminal prompt will change to indicate that the virtual environment is activated.

3. **Install dependencies**:

   - With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. **Deactivate the virtual environment** (when done working on the project):
   - Run `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment.
